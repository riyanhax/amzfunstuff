        * Marshall: Lily, when Evel Knievel sat his stride to star spangled rocket to the on the rim of Snake River Canon, do you think his wife said get down from there?
        * Lily: For the last time I am not Linda Knievel. I will never be Linda Knievel
        * no, he flied, failed, and stand up again so to become a legend
    * big bang theory
        * Sheldon: Gentlemen, use your imagination. Innovate. Did Han Solo let Luke Skywalker freeze to death on the ice planet of Hoth? No. He cut open a tauntaun and used its internal body heat to warm him up.
        * Sheldon: Did Davy Crockett quit at the Alamo? (when they were surrounded and outnumbered by the mexican army? no they fought until the last men and were remembered as heroes...)
    * two and half men
        * Jake: Berta, you know what's a good book? Lord of the Flies.
        * Berta: Oh, yeah. I read that when I was about your age.
        * Jake: So, what'd you think? 
        * Berta: I liked it. It was like Survivor with kids.

        * Charlie: Okay, I think I got it. The demons Oshikuru fights only exist because they are a reflection of the tortured demons in his own soul.
        * Jake: Yes.
        * Charlie: So, in essence Oshikuru is like a Japanese sci-fi version of Moby Dick.
